nas software sucks; for eample synology:
- Drive desktp app
  - should support synchronisation via QuickConnet (internet) and local network when avaliable, but it doesn't! you need to choose one of them. 
  - I would like to choose sync on demand based on rules, eg only files above 50mb wouldbe synced on demand
