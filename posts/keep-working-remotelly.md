# #1st ver Why should we keep remote work as a permament system? (speaking politcally)

Political reasons

Ecology \- reducing CO2

* Transportation emissions  
* Food waste  
* Disposable plastic

Point out class conflict

* Upper management: heads, CEOs, boards members  
* They are property owners and they lose money if we stay remote  
  * Long term remote work leads to leads to decrease in property values/prices  
    * They are paying costs of maintenance  
  * Part of upper-middle class consumers (more affluent white collar workers) will move out from big cities  
    * lower revenue from shopping malls **& office space**  
    * Smaller amount of mortgages (morgeges)  
    * smaller number of people applying for mortgages  
    *

# 2nd ver: # Remote work is saving the planet. Why don’t we stay remote permanently?

When lockdown was introduced, the media told us that “when the world stopped, we significantly reduced CO2 emissions”. But what exactly means “the world stopped”? It basically means: white collar workers are working from home. Almost everyone else worked as before. 

So… living in a big city, working in the office every day have a huge impact on CO2 emissions. That makes sense. 

Traveling is a huge CO2 source. And we make those pointless travels every day. That accumulates during years and with scale millions of other workers like you. Pointless CO2 emissions. That comes with other types of air conntaminations. 

There are also other ways how working in office increase CO2 emissions. Eating outside often means food waste. It also often means creating a huge amount of trashes. 

We should also notice that the fashion industry is huge CO2 emiter. And we are buying much less clothes while working remote. Working in office create a psychologicall pressure to looks good and buy more cloths. But while working remotely we expect better quality. When you dont need to show yourself, we can focus on whats practical. 

Fast fasion. Low quality. Speeding up the tempo of circulating money in the economy. Pointless CO2 emissons. 

I know that fast fasion was a source of gigantic profits. But those are not my profits. Why we \- as society \- should support a model of economy, that is 

Some will say “that the rules of the capitalism that we accepted”. But this model is toxic. Pressre to look bettr. Its toxic for our psychological well-being and toxic for out planet. 

Remote work. Why should we allow it permanently and why bad people wants us back in the office 

This is the moment when discussion about coming back to the offices starts. Business is thinking about getting us \- emoployess \- back to the offices, in some cases getting us back to the big cities. 

But… is it a good idea to come back to the office?  
What are good arguments to stay at home permanently?

Should we come back to the offices? Or should we keep remote working as a permanent model of work for white collars? 

**CO2 emissions reduction**

Has anyone calculated how we reduced our CO2 emissions thanks to remote work? I suspect remote work is extremely eco-friendly. 

EU \- where I live \- is spending a huge amount of money to decarbonize. 

There is good news\! Thanks to COVID we discovered and tested a free way to decrease emissions \- PERMANENT REMOTE WORK. We can let people stay home. €0 invested. Just some legislation that obligates companies to let white collars who worked remotely stay remote permanently. 

Let’s think about how we can reduce emissions this way, every day:

* No need to transport to the office and back every day  
* No eating food outside, no food waste and plastic boxes  
* Fashion is a huge CO2 emiter. Working home we buy less clothes. 

But… business will lost. Right?

* Decreased demand for cars, clothes, etc.  
* Decraseed income of shopping malls and restaurants  
* Decreasing prices of the space in the cities (offices, flats) and prices of properties

That could lead to the crisis, right?   
Or just business can lost.

Did you ever think who wants us back?  
Does your manager really want to back to the office?   
In most cases those are some directors od CEO who are pushed by someone higher. 

People, who already have elastic time of work. People who earn much more then we. I don’t suggest marksits war of social classes but it at least looks like conflict of their intrests. We, as a class of workers, and they as a class of high-managment and capital owners. People who has some profit margin from what they own and they are afraid to loose. 

2y of remote work proved that remote work is working :) They would like us back because staying at home will decrease praces of they properties.

What would happend if we would allow WC to work remotelu pernamently?

* Some of them would move out big cities, and move to cheaper and more peacefull places  
* Some of them would sell their homes/flats in those big cities  
* A lot of workers would move to the hotter counties (in case of UE, huge migration of IT-workers, could simuate economy of the South Europe). Living in hotter countruy may also reduce some emissions, as you basically need less there.  
* Huge amount of ppl with big slaarties will move out of cities  
* That means that shopping malls will sell less and it will be much harder to sell so expensive products in this amoutns. That will lead to decreasing reveune from shoping areas.  
* Companies will free their offices, that will lead to decreasing reveniue froem office areas.  
* And of course prices of homes and flats will decrease. 

For investors that can mean crisis. For Mother Earth It will mean release and breath. 

Should we support this toxic model of economy just because it generates profits for the people who even don’t pay enough taxes? 

So it basically means that organised capital wants us back.

It’s time to say it out ouf the loud: we should stay remote permanently.

Big cities are overcrowded. You live in small flat, in small space. You are
