Recently, I came across a disturbing situation that sparked an idea for solving urban vandalism. Someone had climbed the 90-meter pylon of the Świętokrzyski Bridge in Warsaw, Poland to leave their mark - a graffiti tag. 
               
This incident led me to share my long-term vision for efficiently tackling this problem and implementing a practical punishment system:

> "Such tags should be recorded in a database, and there should be a special unit dedicated to tracking down the authors over the years and charging them for removal costs. A handwriting expert would be able to confirm authorship..."

Building on this initial concept, I'd like to present a practical implementation approach for this solution:

## The Power of Deterrence Through Database Tracking

The core idea isn't about prevention - it's about creating a strong deterrent effect. By establishing a comprehensive database of tags, we increase:

*   The probability of catching perpetrators when connecting them to their other tags in the database
*   The financial consequences through accumulated cleaning costs
*   The risk of being caught even years after the act

## The Role of Forensic Analysis

Graffiti tags are particularly suitable for forensic analysis because:

*   Taggers develop and practice their distinct signatures repeatedly
*   These signatures maintain consistent patterns over time
*   Tags are often replicated in the same style across different locations
*   With machine learning pattern recognition technology, identifying matching tags becomes even more feasible

## Cost Recovery and Long-term Tracking

One of the most significant aspects of this proposal is the extended tracking capability. As taggers continue their activities, each new incident provides another opportunity for identification - whether through security cameras, witnesses, or pattern matching with known tags.

## Removing the Statute of Limitations

A crucial aspect that needs to be addressed is the statute of limitations on vandalism cases. We should consider making these types of vandalism cases exempt from traditional time limitations because:

*   The extended timeframe increases the chances of identification through repeated incidents
*   Each new tag creates another opportunity to connect the perpetrator with their previous acts
*   The risk of being held accountable indefinitely serves as a powerful deterrent

## Integration with EU Digital Initiatives

This database could be implemented as part of the broader European digitalization project. The benefits of joint development include:

*   Standardization across EU member states
*   Shared development and maintenance costs across the entire EU
*   Common software and server infrastructure for law enforcement
*   Public reporting capability through a unified application

This is exactly the kind of project that demonstrates the advantages of common digitalization - it provides both standardization benefits and cost-sharing opportunities across the EU.

## Privacy and Legal Considerations

Of course, any such system would need to carefully balance enforcement with privacy rights and legal considerations. Questions we'd need to address include:

*   Data protection and storage under GDPR guidelines
*   Due process in identification and prosecution
*   Integration with existing law enforcement systems

## Moving Forward

While this might seem like an extensive response to graffiti, it represents an efficient way to address a persistent urban problem. The combination of unlimited statute of limitations and a comprehensive European database creates a strong deterrent effect while providing cities with a mechanism for cost recovery.

What are your thoughts on this approach? Would this systematic tracking and deterrence system help reduce urban vandalism, or are there better solutions we should consider?
