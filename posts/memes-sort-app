## Overview 

I have huge directories of memes, funny AI gen art, charts, infographics, etc. 

I am not only one. 

We all need an app that could sort it for us. 

## Features

Expected features:

* categorization
* tagging
* OCR

## What already exists
* [Dank Meme Organizer](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9ph82c7q4xc5) - just GUI for dir with meme dir (Win)
* [https://github.com/aryaminus/memento](Memento) - some demo with ocr and rotation fixing (Linux)
- Just upload them on Pinterest
