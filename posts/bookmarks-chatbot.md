## First draft

``` md
hatbot that allows semantic search across bookmarks and assist with organizing them.

let user to addd additional info about purpose of folders, instructions what to add there and what not (add here only products for village house, not for apartament in capital)

scrap all bookmarks and build database about them providing screenshot & AI summary and categorization

propose smart relocation: perform sematic search, find similar & propose relocation based on found patterns (i found 3 movies and 1 tv series in your bookmarks outside of "To Watch" folder. do you want to move them here?)

wiget that alows semantic search "gold led chailander i added in previous montch from chinese supplier" (search via tags/summary, datetime, url)

when adding bookmark asks users for additional info (is is intended for village house or apartament in capital?)
