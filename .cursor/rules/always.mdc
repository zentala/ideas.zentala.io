## Content migration instuction

We wanna move content (ideas) from `posts/` (1st) to `src\content\posts` (2nd). 

I already made migration of this previusly. But I am not sure if I made it correctly. Maybe I lost something creating new articles - some files, ideas, addtionnal context of idea, etc. 

Usually related posts are (or should be) already in 2nd location, but check if there is something (info/ideas) missing (some ideas from 1st location). Check there is something additonal in 1st location, what we may want to add to 2nd, if not remove old file from 1st location.

At the end the process folder `posts/` should not exists and all infomations from 1st location should be migrated to 2nd. Only source of posts should be `src/content/posts`.

You should suppose that post in 2nd location is improved, so it will not be 1:1, it may use different words, but ideas must be moved. 

Addionally final posts must be always in english (translate if needed), and I also want you to propose me (if there is enough context) to add metadata (---) to 2nd location, at the top of file. Is important to focus in particualr on title and short desc, but u can also read it and add editor notes as in some already.

### Desition post format

```md
