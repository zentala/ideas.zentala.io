# Rules

## Content

I am editor and you are my assistant and we are refining blog content for author.

## Konow-how

Suggest to editor to:

1) can check almost finshed articles in [Claude](https://claude.ai/) becase on theirs website claude 4 (instead of 3.5) is avaliable for free, so it can be better
   
2) experiment with google imagegen3 to generate thumbs; experminet and check various free imagen tools, check what are most popular and [best at the momemnt](https://zapier.com/blog/best-ai-image-generator/) and spent up to 4h playing with them, in particular when it is hard to find image for post; thumbs should be 16:9 proportions


## Tasks for editor

Follow tasks list:

## Next TODO tasks

(all paths are relative to repo root)

#### Images propostions

[ ] setup box.com account 
[ ] push there images propositons you have for author
[ ] add to all arts that have content ideas for promts and keywords serach for images

#### Wroking on content

[ ] check [filename_typo]
[ ] make [missing_content](mdc:.cursor/missing.md) list
[ ] process new contnet from `posts/`
[ ] remove `#` (h1) from every md file, dont use h1 in posts, ensure content of h1 from post is in metadata tile
[ ] check if there are some posts in `src/content/posts/` that wasn't redacted (not everthing was in 1st location)
    [ ] eg `src/content/posts/meme-sort-app.md`

#### Next steps

[ ] open `zentala.agency` repo and follow `TODO.md`

### Content migration instuction

We wanna move content (ideas) from `posts/` (1st) to `src\content\posts` (2nd). 

I already made migration of this previusly. But I am not sure if I made it correctly. Maybe I lost something creating new articles - some files, ideas, addtionnal context of idea, etc. 

Usually related posts are (or should be) already in 2nd location, but check if there is something (info/ideas) missing (some ideas from 1st location). Check there is something additonal in 1st location, what we may want to add to 2nd, if not remove old file from 1st location.

At the end the process folder `posts/` should not exists and all infomations from 1st location should be migrated to 2nd. Only source of posts should be `src/content/posts`.

You should suppose that post in 2nd location is improved, so it will not be 1:1, it may use different words, but ideas must be moved. 

Addionally final posts must be always in english (translate if needed), and I also want you to propose me (if there is enough context) to add metadata (---) to 2nd location, at the top of file. Is important to focus in particualr on title and short desc, but u can also read it and add editor notes as in some already.

### Desition post format

(we dont want to use h1 in article md `#`, h1 will be generated from metadata `title`)

```md

## summary
0) clean contnent of `posts/` moving info/ideas to `src/contnet/posts/`
1) improve text, dont lost my style, fix grama, translate to eng, add editor notes
2) create proper metadata - title desc (visible on hompe page) - most important

## additional instruction

- if there is any post (Anywhere) about backstage or developer expiernce move it to zentala.agency repository (and commit! and push!)
- dont paste indonesian into articles, I will ask u for indonesian translation because I am (editor) Indonesian, so I want to know on what I am working on
- [missing_content] when migrating (or in 2nd location already) some articles will be empty or not finished; therefore provide author list of missing content in [missing.md](mdc:.cursor/missing.md)
- [filename_typo] check if there is no typo in filename
