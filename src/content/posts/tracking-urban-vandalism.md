**Excerpt:** A thought-provoking discussion about establishing a database system for tracking graffiti taggers and their impact on urban infrastructure.

Recently, I came across a disturbing situation that sparked an idea for solving urban vandalism. Someone had climbed the 90-meter pylon of the Świętokrzyski Bridge in Warsaw, Poland to leave their mark - a graffiti tag.

This incident led me to share my long-term vision for efficiently tackling this problem and implementing a practical punishment system:

> "Such tags should be recorded in a database, and there should be a special unit dedicated to tracking down the authors over the years and charging them for removal costs. A handwriting expert would be able to confirm authorship..."

Building on this initial concept, I'd like to present a practical implementation approach for this solution:

## The Power of Deterrence Through Database Tracking

The core idea isn't about prevention - it's about creating a strong deterrent effect. By establishing a comprehensive database of tags, we increase:

- The probability of catching perpetrators when connecting them to their other tags in the database
- The financial consequences through accumulated punishment & cleaning costs
- The risk of being caught even years after the act

## The Role of Forensic Analysis

Graffiti tags are particularly suitable for forensic analysis because:

- Taggers develop and practice their distinct signatures repeatedly
- These signatures maintain consistent patterns over time
- Tags are often replicated in the same style across different locations
- With machine learning pattern recognition technology, identifying matching tags becomes even more feasible

## Cost Recovery and Long-term Tracking

One of the most significant aspects of this proposal is the extended tracking capability. As taggers continue their activities, each new incident provides another opportunity for identification - whether through security cameras, witnesses, or pattern matching with known tags.

## Removing the Statute of Limitations

A crucial aspect that needs to be addressed is the statute of limitations on vandalism cases. We should consider making these types of vandalism cases exempt from traditional time limitations because:

- The extended timeframe increases the chances of identification through repeated incidents
- Each new tag creates another opportunity to connect the perpetrator with their previous acts
- The risk of being held accountable indefinitely serves as a powerful deterrent

## Integration with EU Digital Initiatives

This database could be implemented as part of the broader European digitalization project. The benefits of joint development include:

- Standardization across EU member states
- Shared development and maintenance costs across the entire EU
- Common software and server infrastructure for law enforcement
- Public reporting capability through a unified application

This is exactly the kind of project that demonstrates the advantages of common digitalization - it provides both standardization benefits and cost-sharing opportunities across the EU.
