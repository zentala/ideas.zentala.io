I was just thinking about a personal project management tool. I named my project idea "Scrum My Life," but I never had the time or a complete vision to finish it. 

I would implement a chatbot that asks coaching questions and, based on responses, helps users design projects, tasks, and habits to follow. This is how I wanted to separate entity types in my app (tasks, habits, events (calendar), projects, rewards, goals).

* Habbits - check consistency, points for keeping up, minus points for skipping
* Rewards - for filfulling some goals or getting enough points

Additionally, I wanted to use the Eisenhower matrix to judge the importance of goals, projects, tasks and scrum points to split them into smaller tasks.
