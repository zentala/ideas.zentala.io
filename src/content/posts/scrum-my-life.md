# Scrum My Life

I was just thinking about a personal project management tool. I named my project idea **'Scrum My Life'** but never had the time or a complete vision to finish it.

I would implement a chatbot that asks coaching questions and, based on responses, helps users design projects, tasks, and habits to follow. This is how I wanted to separate entity types in my app: tasks, habits, events (calendar), projects, rewards, and goals.

- **Habits** - check consistency, points for keeping up, minus points for skipping
- **Rewards** - for fulfilling goals or gaining enough points

Additionally, I wanted to use the Eisenhower matrix to assess the importance of goals, projects, tasks, and scrum points to break them into smaller tasks.
