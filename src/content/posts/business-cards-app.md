Wirtualize business cards. 
* Whenever we touch others phones with NFC we can automatically exchange our business cards.
* This could be default behavior for NFC when two phones touch each other. No additioal action needed. Adding comment or photo possible, but optional.
* There should be mobile app with list of business cards (contats) exchanged this way, linked to some kind of calendar (when was it). So I could easily browse all people I meet on specyfic event.
