# Business Cards App

Virtualize business cards.
* Whenever we touch others' phones with NFC, we can automatically exchange our business cards.
* This could be the default behavior for NFC when two phones touch each other. No additional action needed. Adding a comment or photo is possible but optional.
* There should be a mobile app with a list of business cards (contacts) exchanged this way, linked to some kind of calendar (indicating when it happened). This way, I could easily browse all the people I meet at specific events.
