When lockdown was introduced, media reported that "when the world stopped, we significantly reduced CO2 emissions." But what exactly does "the world stopped" mean? Essentially, it means white-collar workers began working from home. Almost everyone else continued working as before.

This reveals a crucial insight: living in big cities and commuting to offices daily has enormous environmental impact. The accumulation of pointless daily travel by millions of workers generates massive, unnecessary CO2 emissions and air pollution.

## Environmental Benefits of Remote Work

### Transportation Emissions Reduction
Daily commuting represents one of the largest sources of personal carbon footprints. Remote work eliminates:
- Daily car trips to and from offices
- Public transportation usage for commuting
- Business travel for meetings that can be conducted virtually
- Peak-hour traffic congestion and associated emissions

### Reduced Consumption Patterns

**Food Waste Reduction:** Working from home significantly decreases food waste. Office eating often involves:
- Disposable packaging and containers
- Over-ordering due to limited lunch break timing
- Food spoilage from inability to properly store leftovers

**Fashion Industry Impact:** Remote work dramatically reduces clothing purchases. The fashion industry is a major CO2 emitter, and office work creates psychological pressure to constantly update wardrobes. Remote work shifts focus from appearance to functionality, reducing participation in fast fashion cycles.

## The Hidden Economic Interests

### Who Really Wants Us Back?
The push to return to offices often comes from upper management - directors and CEOs who already enjoy flexible schedules and earn significantly more than regular employees. This creates a conflict of interests between:

**Workers:** Who benefit from remote work flexibility, reduced costs, and better work-life balance

**Capital Owners:** Who lose money when commercial real estate values decline and consumer spending decreases in city centers

### Economic Consequences of Permanent Remote Work

If white-collar workers were allowed to work remotely permanently:

**Population Migration:**
- Workers moving from expensive cities to affordable, peaceful locations
- Mass migration of IT workers to warmer countries (stimulating Southern European economies)
- Reduced housing demand in major urban centers

**Commercial Real Estate Impact:**
- Companies downsizing office spaces
- Decreased demand for commercial properties
- Reduced revenue from office building rentals

**Retail and Hospitality Effects:**
- Shopping malls experiencing reduced foot traffic
- Restaurants near business districts losing customers
- Overall decreased urban commercial activity

**Housing Market Changes:**
- Decreased residential property values in major cities
- Reduced mortgage applications
- Shifted housing demand from urban to rural/suburban areas

## The Class Conflict Perspective

This isn't just about work preferences - it represents a fundamental conflict between organized capital and worker interests. Property owners and investors fear the economic consequences of permanent remote work because it threatens their revenue streams from:
- Commercial real estate investments
- Urban retail properties
- City-center hospitality businesses

Meanwhile, workers benefit from:
- Reduced living costs
- Better work-life balance
- Freedom to choose living locations based on personal preferences rather than job proximity
- Decreased participation in environmentally harmful consumption patterns

## Environmental Policy Implications

The European Union spends enormous amounts on decarbonization initiatives. Remote work offers a **free** method to reduce emissions significantly - requiring only legislation that obligates companies to allow eligible white-collar workers to remain remote permanently.

This policy would cost â‚¬0 to implement while delivering substantial environmental benefits through:
- Immediate transportation emission reductions
- Decreased urban infrastructure strain
- Reduced commercial energy consumption
- Lower overall resource consumption

## Addressing Urban Overcrowding

Big cities suffer from overcrowding, leading to:
- Small, expensive living spaces
- High stress levels and reduced quality of life
- Environmental degradation from population density
- Infrastructure strain

Remote work naturally addresses these issues by:
- Distributing population more evenly across regions
- Reducing pressure on urban infrastructure
- Allowing people to live in larger, more affordable spaces
- Decreasing urban pollution and congestion

## The Two-Year Proof

Two years of forced remote work proved that remote work functions effectively for most white-collar positions. The desire to return workers to offices isn't based on productivity concerns - it's motivated by economic interests of property owners who fear decreased real estate values.

## A Sustainable Future Model

We should embrace permanent remote work as part of a broader environmental and social strategy. This isn't just about convenience - it's about:

**Environmental Responsibility:** Dramatically reducing our carbon footprint through changed work patterns

**Social Equity:** Allowing workers to choose living locations based on personal values rather than employment constraints

**Economic Justice:** Refusing to support a toxic economic model that prioritizes property values over environmental health and worker wellbeing

**Quality of Life:** Creating space for more balanced, healthier lifestyles that don't revolve around commuting and urban consumption

The question isn't whether remote work is effective - we've proven it works. The question is whether we'll prioritize environmental sustainability and worker wellbeing over the profit margins of property investors.

It's time to say it loudly: **we should stay remote permanently.**

Why should we keep remote work as a permanent system? (speaking politically)

When lockdown was introduced, the media told us that "when the world stopped, we significantly reduced CO2 emissions". But what exactly means "the world stopped"? It basically means: white collar workers are working from home. Almost everyone else worked as before.

Remote work. Why should we allow it permanently and why bad people wants us back in the office.

Has anyone calculated how we reduced our CO2 emissions thanks to remote work? I suspect remote work is extremely eco-friendly.

EU is spending a huge amount of money to decarbonize. There is good news! Thanks to COVID we discovered and tested a free way to decrease emissions - PERMANENT REMOTE WORK.
