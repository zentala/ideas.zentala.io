# IoT RFID Button

## Blog Idea: RFiD Tag with a Button – Secure and Minimalist Solution

### Concept Overview

This idea expands on a 13.56MHz RFiD tag (ISO14443-A standard) with a button that enables users to switch between multiple codes. A single tag could serve several purposes, such as:

- Accessing the building’s intercom system
- Unlocking the garbage disposal area
- Any other RFiD-enabled system (e.g., doors in your home or office)

**Additional Feature for Security:**
Since the tag includes a button, it can offer a passive security mode where it remains dormant and does not transmit any code until the button is pressed. This feature prevents unauthorized scanning of the tag, such as when it's in your pocket or wallet. This protects against relay attacks where an attacker tries to read RFiD codes without your consent.

### Why This is Valuable:

1. **Security Advantage:**
   - The tag is effectively unreadable unless activated manually.
   - Users can carry it without worrying about unauthorized access when close to an RFiD reader (e.g., an attacker brushing against you in a crowded place).

2. **Minimalist Approach:**
   - A single tag replaces multiple tags, reducing clutter in your pocket or wallet.
   - Fits perfectly into a minimalist lifestyle. For example, I carry only:
     - A slim wallet (smaller than a folded banknote) that holds:
       - 3 cards (ID and bank cards)
       - Banknotes under a magnetic clip
     - No coins or bulky items
   - A multi-code RFiD tag aligns with this minimalist philosophy: fewer, simpler items to carry.

### Additional Use Cases

- **Smart Home Integration:**
  - Use the tag to unlock doors inside your home or apartment via RFiD.
  - Great for families or companies where one tag can hold multiple credentials (e.g., shared office access).
- **Corporate Security:**
  - Employees could have one premium tag for all secure zones, with added safety through manual activation.

### Benefits of the Product

1. **Security:**
   - Prevents unauthorized scanning unless activated.
   - Ideal for personal use and companies prioritizing secure access control.
2. **Convenience:**
   - One tag replaces multiple.
   - Fits seamlessly into a minimalist lifestyle or small wallets.
3. **Premium Appeal:**
   - A secure, compact, and versatile product that caters to both safety and style.
   - Offers added functionality for smart homes or modern workplaces.

### Challenges to Address

1. **Durability:**
   - The button must withstand daily use and exposure to environmental factors like dust or moisture.
2. **Power Source:**
   - Implementing the button and switching mechanism might require a power source. Possible solutions:
     - Energy harvesting from the reader’s field
     - A long-lasting, small battery
3. **Cost vs. Benefit:**
   - Ensure the premium features justify the added cost compared to standard RFiD tags.
