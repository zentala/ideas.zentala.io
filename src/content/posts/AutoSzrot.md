It seems like "AutoSzrot" is a platform idea centered around a car parts and vehicle subscription service with added features like geolocation and photo uploads. To start refining this into a comprehensive article, let's clarify and expand on some key elements.

1. **Purpose and Functionality**:
   - Could you explain more about the main purpose of the AutoSzrot platform? Is it primarily for individuals looking for specific car parts, or does it also cater to auto repair businesses?
   - How does the subscription model work on this platform? What are subscribers signing up for exactly?

2. **Features**:
   - You mentioned geolocation; can you elaborate on how this feature is integrated into the service? For instance, how does it enhance the user experience?
   - Regarding the photo uploads, what types of photos are users expected to upload? Are these photos of the car parts, the vehicles, or both?

3. **User Interaction and Engagement**:
   - How do users interact with each other on the platform? Is there a feature for user ratings or feedback on transactions?
   - What are the benefits for a user subscribing to notifications about specific car models or parts?

These questions will help us better understand the platform's scope and functionality, enabling us to draft a clearer and more detailed article.

🤖 Thank you for providing a detailed explanation of the concept of "szrot" in Poland and how it relates to the AutoSzrot platform. This information is extremely useful for understanding the cultural and practical aspects of the market you're targeting. Given the challenges and needs you've described, it's clear that AutoSzrot aims to revolutionize the way people find and purchase used car parts in Poland, particularly for older vehicles where parts may no longer be in production.

Let's break this down into several key sections to structure our article effectively:

### 1. Introduction
- Briefly introduce the concept of "szrot" and its importance in the Polish market for used cars and parts.
- State the problem: difficulty in finding specific used parts for older car models, lack of a centralized system for notification and purchase.

### 2. Solution: The AutoSzrot Platform
- Describe the AutoSzrot platform: an innovative service that allows users to subscribe and be notified when specific car parts or models become available at local scrap yards.
- Explain how users can specify what they are looking for, including part type, preferred price, and location.

### 3. Features and Functionalities
- **Geolocation**: Discuss how this feature helps users find parts nearby to save on shipping costs, especially for larger items.
- **Photo Uploads**: Explain the importance of uploading photos, both for overall views and specific parts, to assist in the visual verification of the item's condition.
- **Subscription Notifications**: Detail how subscribing to notifications allows users to be immediately informed when a part they need is listed.
- **User Interaction**: Mention potential features like user ratings or feedback systems to build trust and community.

### 4. Benefits for Users
- **Cost-Effective**: Finding parts for older models that are no longer produced, potentially at lower prices.
- **Time-Saving**: Reducing the time spent searching for parts manually across multiple scrap yards.
- **Car Tuning and Upgrades**: Access to unique parts for car tuning and upgrades.

### 5. Market Impact and Business Model
- Discuss how AutoSzrot benefits both the sellers (scrap yards) by providing an additional revenue stream before scrapping cars and buyers by increasing the parts availability and potentially driving prices down.
- Explain the pricing model for listings and how it can be dynamic based on demand and part rarity.

### 6. Challenges and Future Outlook
- Address potential challenges such as verifying the quality of parts and ensuring the reliability of listings.
- Speculate on future enhancements like implementing a verification system or expanding services beyond local regions.

Would you like to add any specific examples or additional features to this outline before we proceed with drafting the full article?

Your response (type "done" to finish, "save" to save progress, "generate" to create final posts): uzytkownicy moga wybrac co chca po numerach czesci, rozni producji maja jakies swoje oznacznia oraz po obrazach, czasami czesci nie rytlko bda mialy numery ale i obrazy beda w bazuie. z czasem bedzemy robili tak ze user wyciaga telefon i robi zdjeice czesci, tabliczi i wpisuje dane swojego auta (zakladajac konto czy pozniej), ale majac dane auta i te zdjhecia bedziemy mogli pomoc mu rozpoznac czego szuka, ew zadac pytania dodatkowe. wiec dla usera wartisca bedzie tez pomoc w znaaowaniu precyzjnie tej czecsi jakiej szuka. geolocation- u can receive part on your own, most people who fix cars also drive and have few cars co they can recieve it on their own in theis area eg 60-80km from place whrre this person is lving, when I am looking for a part I can choos if I want shipment or if I want in area near me to be notified only. this is why geolocaitoastion is impotnt. photos are also for ai, not only for users, also for ai to descibe car and get more info about it to know who notified. also to examine car photos and ask seller additonal questions if lllm agent will judge something is m

🤖 Thank you for elaborating on the user interaction and technological aspects of the AutoSzrot platform. The integration of part identification through photos and part numbers, as well as the use of AI to assist in the identification process, adds significant value to the platform. Let's incorporate these details into the article structure:

### 3. Features and Functionalities (Updated Section)
- **Part Identification through Photos and Numbers**: Highlight how users can search for parts using OEM part numbers or visual identification. Discuss the future capability where users can take a photo of the part or the part number plate, which, combined with vehicle data entered during account setup, allows the platform to assist in identifying the correct part. Mention how AI will eventually aid in recognizing parts from photos to streamline this process.
- **Geolocation**: Emphasize how this feature not only helps in locating parts nearby but also offers flexibility in delivery options. Users can choose to receive notifications for parts available within a certain distance (e.g., 60-80 km) and decide whether they prefer to pick up the parts themselves or have them shipped.
- **Photo Uploads for AI Analysis**: Explain that the photos uploaded by users and scrap yards are utilized by AI to better describe the car and its condition, ensuring that buyers are well-informed before making a purchase. This AI functionality can also prompt sellers to provide additional information or photos if initial uploads are insufficient or unclear.

### 5. Technological Advancements and User Support
- **AI and Machine Learning**: Discuss how AI is used to analyze uploaded photos for better part identification and to support user queries effectively.
- **User Support**: Highlight the platform's commitment to assisting users in precisely identifying the parts they need, reducing the likelihood of incorrect purchases and enhancing user satisfaction.

### Additional Considerations
- **Privacy and Data Security**: Since users will be uploading photos and possibly sensitive information about their vehicles, mention how AutoSzrot ensures data privacy and security.
- **User Education**: Consider a section on how the platform plans to educate users about using these advanced features, such as photo uploads for AI analysis and the importance of accurate part identification.

This revised section layout should provide a clear and detailed explanation of how AutoSzrot works and the benefits it offers to users. Would you like to add information about any specific technologies used in the AI process, or should we proceed with detailing another section of the article?
