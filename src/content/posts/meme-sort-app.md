# Meme Sort App

## Overview 

Many people, including myself, have huge directories of memes, funny AI-generated art, charts, infographics, etc. We all need an app that could sort and organize this content effectively.

## Features

Expected features:
* Automatic categorization
* Smart tagging system
* OCR for text extraction and searchability

## Existing Solutions
* [Dank Meme Organizer](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9ph82c7q4xc5) - Basic GUI for meme directory management (Windows)
* [Memento](https://github.com/aryaminus/memento) - Demo with OCR and rotation fixing capabilities (Linux)
* Pinterest - General purpose image organization platform
