# Free Volunteer Service Platform

Imagine you want to create something for your portfolio because you're just starting work in an industry, or you want to write a paper for university, or conduct research. You're looking for ideas on who to help and what interesting things to do, without disrupting the market while creating something valuable for your portfolio or studies.

This is where a not-yet-existing service would come in, connecting such individuals with foundations, non-profit organizations, and other initiatives worth supporting for free. This way, you're simultaneously building your portfolio and supporting good initiatives with your work (which you would have done anyway), while not undercutting the market since these organizations wouldn't have purchased your services otherwise. At the same time, this effort could be groundbreaking through the power of community work - for example, when a community conducts dozens of studies in natural building and creates a website with their findings, etc.

Another scenario: I have my own open-source projects, like a smart height-adjustable desk, and I'm looking for people who would like to design something for it in 3D and print it, or create a PCB board, or help in other ways.

Or perhaps we have a volunteer foundation or public good organization that needs volunteers, research work, etc. We connect students or people who want to build their portfolio or learn with those who need help.
