## The Vision: IT Village on a Paradise Island

In an era of inflation-driven economic uncertainty, I'm exploring investment opportunities abroad, particularly land in Asia. The concept involves purchasing a small plot (3 acres) on a tropical island, ordering a 35m² house from Poland, shipping it by container to Asia, and establishing it on the plot.

Asia often lacks quality housing materials, while Poland offers relatively affordable, first-class prefabricated houses. These finished homes can be shipped overseas and assembled on-site.

Each house would feature an ergonomic workspace with height-adjustable desk, ergonomic chair, and 2-3 monitors. The plot size allows for easy addition of a second building for workshops or guest accommodation.

## Community Investment Model

Rather than individual investment, I propose a collective approach: pooling resources for a larger land parcel, subdividing it, building infrastructure (hiring Chinese contractors for water, electricity, and sewage), and ordering multiple houses from Poland for container shipping.

We could develop a housing estate of 5-7 cottages specifically designed for remote work, featuring:
- Starlink satellite internet throughout
- Private water supply
- Sewage treatment system
- Shared facilities (coworking space, large kitchen, guest rooms)

## Location Analysis: Cambodia, Koh Rong Island

**Why Cambodia?**
- Known for Asia's most affordable real estate (though still expensive)
- Sihanoukville region popular with Australian surfers
- Koh Rong: one of two paradise islands in the region
- Limited industrialization keeps land prices relatively accessible

**Investment Requirements:** ~$25,000 USD per participant

**Included Services:**
- Land acquisition
- Plot subdivision
- Legal ownership structure
- Fencing and security
- Utility connections
- Road infrastructure

## Addressing Remote Work Lifestyle Challenges

As software engineers, we spend most of our lives in front of computer screens:
- 8+ hours daily for work
- Additional time for skill development
- Entertainment (Netflix, gaming)
- Writing and content creation

This lifestyle lacks physical movement and connection with nature. Remote work offers time-saving benefits but contributes to sedentary behavior.

**The Solution:** Create living conditions that encourage outdoor activities:
- Beach-front cottages
- Natural surroundings
- Climate promoting outdoor lifestyle
- Balance between digital work and physical activity

## Infrastructure Development

### Land Acquisition Strategies

**Corporate Ownership:** Establish a company to purchase land, with investors controlling through shares rather than direct ownership.

**Local Partnerships:** Partner with local landowners who provide land in exchange for business opportunities (restaurant, hotel, services for remote workers).

### Essential Infrastructure

**Road Access:** Hire Chinese construction developers for cost-effective, quality road building.

**Water Supply Solutions:**
- Avoid well-digging near seawater (saltwater intrusion)
- Rainwater collection systems for non-potable uses
- Imported drinking water via tank delivery
- Grey water recycling for toilets and irrigation
- Multiple piping systems for different water types

**Sewage Treatment:** Prefabricated treatment plants available for under $20,000 (approximately $1,000 per house) for complete waste management.

**Internet Connectivity:** Starlink terminals provide high-speed internet anywhere. At $110/month shared among 20 members = $5.50 per person monthly.

## Economic Benefits for Developers

Companies increasingly seek non-financial compensation methods for developers. Working from paradise locations offers:
- Improved work-life balance
- Reduced living costs
- Investment opportunity
- Rental income when absent
- Community of like-minded professionals

## Regional Trade Advantages

The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) includes 15 Asia-Pacific countries, eliminating tariffs on 90% of product groups over 20 years. This facilitates easier import/export for infrastructure and materials.

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Phase 1:** Land acquisition and legal structure
2. **Phase 2:** Infrastructure development (6-12 months)
3. **Phase 3:** House manufacturing and shipping from Poland
4. **Phase 4:** Assembly and landscaping
5. **Phase 5:** Community establishment and rental management

## Investment Returns

The village would cater to digital nomads and remote workers, generating rental income through:
- Short-term vacation rentals
- Long-term remote worker housing
- Coworking space fees
- Additional services (transportation, meals, activities)

Local management would handle rentals, cleaning, and maintenance, ensuring passive income for investors.

Wisoki w polu w egzotycznych miejsach - praca zdalna dla programistów

W dobie topniejących od inflacji pieniędzy zastanawiam się, gdzie uciekać z oszczędnościami. Rozglądam się za ziemią w Azji. Myślę o zakupie małej działki (3 ary) na rajskiej wyspie, zamówieniu domku 35m2 w PL, wysłaniu go kontenerem do Azji i usadowieniu na działce.

Co powiecie na to aby w kilku zrzucić się na większy kawałek ziemi, podzielić go, zbudować drogę, infrastrukturę (zatrudni się chińskiego kontaktora do wody, prądu i kanalizacji), a za rok zamówić w PL domki i wysłać je kontenerami.

Cottages in the field in exotic places - remote work for programmers

In times of inflation-melting money, I'm wondering where to escape with savings. I'm looking at land in Asia. I'm thinking about buying a small plot (3 acres) on a paradise island, ordering a 35m² house in Poland, shipping it by container to Asia and setting it up on the plot.

What do you think about pooling money for a larger piece of land, dividing it, building infrastructure (hiring a Chinese contractor for water, electricity and sewage), and next year ordering houses from Poland and shipping them in containers.
