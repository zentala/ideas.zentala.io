## Current Limitations
NAS software, particularly Synology's Drive desktop app, has several usability limitations:
- Forced choice between QuickConnect and local network synchronization
- No hybrid connectivity options
- Limited synchronization rules

## Proposed Improvements
### Smart Connectivity
- Automatic switching between QuickConnect and local network
- Prioritize local network when available
- Seamless fallback to QuickConnect when needed

### Advanced Synchronization
- Rule-based synchronization options
- File size thresholds (e.g., >50MB)
- Selective folder sync
- Bandwidth management

## Benefits
- Improved user experience
- More efficient resource usage
- Better network utilization
- Enhanced flexibility

## Editor Notes

### Suggestions to Edit
- Add performance comparison data
- Include user feedback analysis
- Detail technical implementation
- Consider security implications
- Propose testing methodology
