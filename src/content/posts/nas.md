NAS software can be frustrating. For example, Synology's Drive desktop app should support synchronization via QuickConnect and local network when available, but it doesn't. Users are forced to choose between the two. It would be beneficial to have the option to sync on demand based on rules, such as syncing only files above 50MB.
