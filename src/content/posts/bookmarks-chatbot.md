## The Problem
Traditional bookmark managers often become digital graveyards, overflowing with unorganized links that are impossible to find later. Users struggle with generic tags, outdated information, and a distinct lack of context, making their saved content inaccessible and ultimately unusable. The sheer volume of online information today makes manual organization inefficient and unsustainable, leading to valuable links being lost in a chaotic sea of saved pages.

. add a feature where the system proactively asks users for additional context (like "Is this for the village house or the city apartment?") when they're adding a new bookmark. 

The idea of the system proactively asking users for extra context when they're adding a new bookmark is in Draft 1 'Post/' ("when adding bookmark asks users for additional info...") but it's not explicitly and separately detailed in Draft 2 'src/content/post'.

Draft 2 'src/content/post'. has "Folder Insights" (where users can set rules for folders), but Draft 1 suggests a more active AI interaction where the AI itself asks the contextual questions during the bookmark-adding process. This would be a valuable addition to the user experience.
