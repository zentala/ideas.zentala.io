# Cemetery Map – Digital Memory and Care for Loved Ones

Cemetery Map is an innovative web and mobile platform designed to preserve the memory of your loved ones and their burial places for eternity. It utilizes precise 3D mapping technology derived from drone photography, satellite imagery, and LIDAR scans of cemeteries. The mobile application will offer AR navigation around cemeteries, allowing users to save grave locations and easily revisit them using augmented reality.

Thanks to this, you will never forget where your loved ones are buried. Next time you visit the cemetery, a fully charged smartphone will be all you need to locate their graves effortlessly. Our mission is to permanently preserve the locations of graves, how to reach them, and especially the memories of the deceased themselves. In 30 years, when visiting a cemetery you haven't seen since childhood, you'll easily find graves introduced to you by your parents or grandparents. You will be able to travel back in time by viewing digitized scans of family photo negatives or listening to audio recordings of deceased ancestors recounting memories of the buried individuals. We aim to add a digital layer to the physical cemetery, enhancing and preserving memory.

Key Problems We Solve:
----------------------

### Fading Family Memories

In today's information overload, our memory weakens because we rely heavily on digital tools. We use this very digitization to preserve the memories of loved ones we never want to forget.

### Family Dispersion

Families often live far from their ancestral burial sites, making regular visits and care challenging.

### Lack of Digital Cemetery Documentation

Many cemeteries lack precise digital maps or clearly defined pathways, making it difficult to locate specific burial plots.

Key Features:
-------------

### Precise Location and AR

*   **Drone and satellite imagery:** Regularly updated to provide an accurate view of cemetery conditions and grave sites, helping visitors decide when and how to maintain graves.
    
*   **Advanced AR navigation:** GPS alone isn't precise enough for pinpointing specific graves, so we use augmented reality to guide users directly to graves via smartphones or AR glasses.
    

### Multimedia Grave Profiles

*   Each grave has its own digital profile, allowing the storage of stories, photos, and audio memories recorded by loved ones.
    
*   Gravestone scanning using phone cameras, OCR technology, and artificial intelligence algorithms to immediately identify graves and access digital profiles.
    

### Social Layer

*   Cost-sharing for grave maintenance among family members (similar to payment-splitting apps like Revolut).
    
*   Information on who currently cares for a grave or recently placed candles.
    
*   Ability to respectfully comment on digital graves, share memories, etc. (experimental).
    

### Genealogy Integration and Family Trees

*   Free or low-cost family tree maintenance on our platform (competitive genealogy platforms can be very expensive).
    
*   Integration and data import from popular genealogy services like MyHeritage and Ancestry.
    
*   Linking genealogy trees with grave and living persons' profiles.
    
*   Discover neglected ancestral graves unknown to overseas relatives, facilitating collective renovation projects.
    

On-demand Services – "Gig Economy" in Cemetery Care
---------------------------------------------------

*   Users can order services like cleaning, inscription renewal, grave restoration, or redesign. Providers have profiles with ratings, allowing choices from artistic floral decorators to stone renovation experts.
    
*   Subscription packages include quarterly grave cleaning, flower replacements, monthly candle changes, and seasonal decorations in premium options.
    

Business Model and Partnerships
-------------------------------

*   Revenue from commissions (5-20%) on mediated services such as grave cleaning, flower deliveries, stonework, conservation, and grave design.
    
*   Freemium model offering extended multimedia storage for premium users.
    
*   Revenue from digitizing old negatives and photos, providing scanning through local partners, and using AI to tag and link images to family trees and graves.
    

Future Vision and Robotics
--------------------------

*   Initial mapping via satellite imagery and drones, evolving into AI-driven drones autonomously capturing detailed grave photos and 3D scans.
    
*   Within 5-10 years, autonomous vehicles carrying autonomous drones performing regular cemetery scans without human intervention.
    
*   Investment in SaaS for cemetery administration, facilitating unified data management and communication with families via our platform.
    
*   In 10 years, investing in robots for grave cleaning tasks like pressure washing and air drying, protecting human workers from harsh weather conditions.
    
*   Within 20 years, robots efficiently sorting and recycling cemetery waste, rented out to local service providers and cemetery administrators.
    
*   In 30 years, eco-friendly grave maintenance by robotic systems, including green graves maintained by artificial intelligence.
    
*   If successful, investing in establishing pet cemeteries worldwide as a separate business venture, acquiring premium land, and designing cemeteries in consultation with pet owners.
    

Specialized Platform Extensions
-------------------------------

*   **Historical Module:** Information on notable individuals, historical tours; every grave potentially becoming a historical profile connected to archival databases.
    
*   **Pet Cemetery Module:** A separate segment or sub-portal for preserving memories of pets, sometimes marking simple memorial trees with links to social media profiles.
    
*   **Digital Funeral Services:** Expansion into digital organization of funeral arrangements and post-funeral grave care preferred by younger generations.
    

Social Impact
-------------

An aging population means that every living person increasingly has more ancestors and relatives to remember. Our platform preserves this memory digitally while simplifying the care of a growing number of graves.

Cemetery Map isn't just an app—it's a comprehensive form of digital care, preserving and immortalizing memories of our deceased loved ones, ushering their legacies into a digital eternity.
