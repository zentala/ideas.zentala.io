# Customizable Marketplace

A marketplace for custom-made, made-to-measure, and customizable products.

## Customer Value Proposition
Do you want to wear something original?
Do you want something custom-made for your home?

## Added Value
The platform's strength lies in creating a UI that allows customers to click through and visualize what they're ordering, while giving sellers the ability to create generators that visualize their custom offerings.

## Business Strategy
- Be a marketplace but also work to automate some of these productions and sell them directly
- Start by listing our own products while enabling others to sell too
- Build companies focused on custom production and robotization
- This can be part of a larger company and business related to customization

## Market Trend
The economy is moving towards greater production customization, and this will be the next level for companies. Customers are already looking for custom products and will want more. Whoever offers customizable products will win the market and beat the competition.

Given that production is moving in this direction and we have many programmers, it puts us in a position where it's worth investing in this.
