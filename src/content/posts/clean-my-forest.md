On the website, there is a map with marked areas where you can collect wood chips. There is an option to add a forest by providing the land register details and verifying ownership. 

As part of social rehabilitation, one can report forests for cleaning up and even designate rewards for cleaning efforts. For instance, teachers take children on trips to the forest to teach them about the importance of cleanliness. Adults and children clean up together, followed by a bonfire organized by the owner for the kids. Alternatively, one could assign convicted individuals to community service cleaning up forests.
