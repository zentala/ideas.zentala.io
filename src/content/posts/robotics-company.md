## Business Opportunity

If I had significant capital to invest right now - living in Poland and having access to our Central European IT talent pool - I would establish a robotics company. Not like Boston Dynamics, but much simpler - focusing on automating straightforward but time-consuming and tedious tasks such as municipal services and agriculture.

## Problem Statement

This addresses two key issues:
- Poland's economic leap forward, as one of the least robotized economies
- Access to high-quality programmers in the region
- Demographic decline, offering an alternative or complement to immigration

## Business Areas

Areas that can be easily scaled, where hardware and robot development costs are low because they spread across wide applications.

## Municipal Services

Consider the scale: How much does a town of 15k spend? How much does Warsaw spend? And how many cities are larger than Warsaw? What if we built a company providing robotized municipal services to 50% of European cities with over 20k inhabitants? That's the business potential we're looking at.

I would start with a fleet of autonomous vehicles for municipal services:
- Waste collection
- Lawn mowing and grass disposal
- Precise weed removal
- Automated monitoring of green areas
- Cleaning of sidewalk tiles (removing dirt between joints)
- Autumn leaf collection
- Cleaning:
  - Cigarette butts and other waste on beaches
  - Small waste on sidewalks
  - Roadside cleaning
  - Forest monitoring and cleaning
- Roads:
  - Street sweeping
  - Winter: snow removal, sand or salt spreading
- Roadside grass trimming
- Monitoring and cleaning of drainage ditches and culverts

These services could also be provided to housing communities, public institutions, religious communities, cemeteries, etc.

## Agriculture

As a second pillar, I would build semi-autonomous robots for agriculture:

### Smart Monitoring
- Animal sound recognition using ML for welfare monitoring
- Autonomous vehicles, tractors, etc.
- Laser weed removal (expensive but effective)
- Robotic fruit and vegetable harvesting (e.g., tomatoes, strawberries)

### Field Management
- Field condition monitoring, irrigation, crop analysis via satellite
- Providing satellite data to farmers about their crops
- Consider free access for small farms and affordable for larger ones (30ha+)

### Mixed Farming Innovation
- Problem: Disease spread in large monoculture fields
- Current solution: Heavy use of sprays to prevent spread
- Better approach:
  - Robotization allows targeted spraying where diseases/pests are detected
  - Mixed, small-scale cultivation can be robotized
  - Reduced need for sprays
  - Less soil depletion
  - Example: On 10ha, create 100 small plots with multiple crops growing together
  - Plants can support each other's growth and naturally deter pests
