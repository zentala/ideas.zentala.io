# NAS Software Improvements

Current NAS software solutions have significant limitations. Taking Synology as an example:

## Drive Desktop App Issues

### Connectivity Limitations
- Should support simultaneous synchronization via QuickConnect (internet) and local network
- Currently forces users to choose one connection method
- Need hybrid connectivity support for optimal performance

### Sync Flexibility
- Need on-demand synchronization based on customizable rules
- Example: Only sync files above 50MB on demand
- Current system lacks granular control over sync behavior

## Editor Notes

### Suggests to edit
- Add comparison with other NAS solutions
- Include detailed feature requests
- Propose technical solutions
- Add use cases for different sync scenarios
- Consider enterprise vs home user needs
