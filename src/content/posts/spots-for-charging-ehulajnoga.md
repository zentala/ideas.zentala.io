## Overview

Strategic placement of charging spots for e-scooters near public seating areas and in urban environments. Private e-scooters could be equipped with standardized charging connectors (e.g., 24V). We need a standard for charging small devices and public chargers.

The charging spots could be:
- Pay-per-use through contactless payment
- Allow token purchase from nearby shops (useful when your phone is out of battery)
- Publicly available for charging other mobile devices too, not just e-scooters

Public charging should be safe, preventing USB-based attacks. This infrastructure should be treated as a public service that enhances social mobility.

The locations of this charging infrastructure should be strategically planned and communicated, similar to how we treat gas stations or phone booths as essential urban infrastructure.
