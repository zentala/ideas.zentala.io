# IT Talent Management in Central Europe

While Western businesses hire our programmers for substantial salaries, local businesses have access to many IT professionals but fail to engage them in ambitious projects like robotics.

I believe local businesses lack vision and ideas. Simply offering equity in the company could motivate these professionals to build and grow the business together.

## Editor Notes

### Original Content (Polish)
```
Zachodni biznes zatrudnia naszych programistów za zawrotne pieniądze, a tymczasem lokalny biznes ma masę informatyków, ale nie gospodaruje nimi na ambitne projekty, takie jak np. robotyka.

Uważam, że lokalnemu biznesowi brakuje pomysłu i idei. Wystarczy dać im udziały w firmie, a będą ją budować razem z wami.

### English Translation
