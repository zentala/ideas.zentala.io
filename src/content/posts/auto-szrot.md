# AutoSzrot

## Introduction
AutoSzrot is a platform connecting car owners seeking specific parts with scrap yards ("szrot" in Polish) that dismantle vehicles. In Poland, where the average car age is among the highest in Europe, finding specific used parts for older models is challenging without a centralized system.

## How It Works
The platform allows scrap yards to list vehicles they're dismantling, complete with photos and detailed information. Users can subscribe to notifications for specific parts they need, such as "Touran hubcaps" or "steering wheel electronics," and receive alerts when matching vehicles become available.

## Key Features
- **Geolocation**: Find parts within a specific radius (e.g., Touran within 50km)
- **Detailed Photos**: Visual verification of parts condition before purchase
- **Subscription System**: Get notified when parts you need become available
- **AI-Assisted Part Identification**: Future feature to help users identify needed parts from photos
- **Part Number Database**: Search by manufacturer part numbers

## Benefits
- **Cost-effective**: Access affordable used parts for older vehicles
- **Time-saving**: No need to constantly call or visit multiple scrap yards
- **Upgrades Made Easy**: Find higher-class parts for vehicle customization (e.g., installing Touran II electronics in a Touran I)
- **Rare Parts Location**: Source parts that are no longer manufactured
