### English Translation from original content (Polish)
```
Scrapyards post information about available vehicles, and customers subscribe to specific car models they're looking for. For example, buying hubcaps or underbody panels for a Touran. They can also order parts like wheel hubs. There's also geolocation, e.g., finding a Touran within 50km radius. Vehicle photos are included. Listing cost is ten units.

Proposed structure:
